# Words on Call

Currently, a Python program that randomly generates a word between 4 and 7 characters long, mostly from Google's most commonly used 10000 words, and gives the user the `length of the word + 1` guesses to guess the word.

## How to use the program:

1. Download the zip file
1. Run ~~`main.py`~~ `wordle2.py`

## To be implemented:

- Integrate communication with Discord
- Allow players to utilize custom wordbanks
- Fix Letterbank Layout
- ~~Rebuild into an OOP-based program~~
